The Nexus Aurora Foundation VR Experience with the aim of creating a platform of the Nexus Aurora communities ideas and designs. Using crowdsourced contributions in a controlled manner on an open-sourced project we are aiming to create a visually stunning experience to inspire the next generation and people interested to think about Mars. Keeping that goal in mind we want to allow for as many platforms and devices to run this VR experience so that we can reach a large as possible audience for education and demonstrating our innovations.
